Weltkrieg: Rise of the Kaiserreich
#####################################

Development has been stopped. For multiple personal reasons I will not continue working on this mod. 
In case I start modding again, I will work on Weltkrieg 2036. Weltkrieg: Rise of the Kaiserreich on the other hand
won't be touched by me ever again. I'm sorry for everyone who liked the mod, but it is what it is.

Everybody who wants to continue my work is allowed to do so. You can also upload a new/continued version to the 
Steam Workshop.

The mod is not quite compatible with 1.6 and needs some more compatibility with DLCs in general. Also the focus trees
could need some rework, they are too short and simple.
