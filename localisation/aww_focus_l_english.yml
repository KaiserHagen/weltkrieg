 #Germany
 moderate_policy_ger_desc:0 "After our victory in the Great War, far right movements have started to gain momentum in the defeated countries in the west, now as the leader of Europe we must be the first to defend other peaceful nations in our continent from the attrocities that the Fascists may commit."
 aggressive_policy_ger_desc:0 "After our victory in the Great War, we occupied territory in West and especially in the East. All of the new Eastern European states were politically,admistratively and economically dependent on us, making them look like semi-automous provinces of our empire rather than dependent nations. Since then, most of these countries were allowed to proclaim their independence but with fascists on the rise in the west, we have expand our influence."
 planungsphase1_ger_desc:0 "This is the first step of our plan in putting our lebensraum in action by forcing the rest of the eastern european states under our control."
 german_imperialism_ger_desc:0 "German Imperialism is a policy that was proved to be right with our victory in the Great War and it is only normal that we continue with it"
 operation_baltikum_ger_desc:0 "The time is right to put our Imperialism policy in action and what better way to start than the frail new Eastern European countries that were not long ago dependent on us."
 subjugate_lithuania_ger_desc:0 "Lithuania is a small and a weak nation. There are still a lot of Germans in their governmental administration which would make it relatively easy for us to subjugate them."
 subjugate_courland_ger_desc:0 "Courland is a country with close to no national identity and even though we tried to stabilize them before, political chaos is still in full swing there which will make it extremely easy for us to subjugate them."
 reformation_of_poland_ger_desc:0 "Poland is a country that was ressurected by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, it is fully administared by us which led to a huge economic increase and better life standards that made the poles be extremely loyal to us and now that Lithunia and Courland are under our control we can finally reform Poland by pushing them Eastward where they can be a perfect bulwark against the Soviets."
 subjugate_latvia_ger_desc:0 "Latvia is too close to us, we need to take control of their control in order to assert our dominance in this region of Europe and prevent a Soviet takeover of the country"
 subjugate_estonia_ger_desc:0 "Estonia was one of the countries that was released from the Russian Empire after our victory in the war, even though they are no longer dependent on us like in the 1920s there are still loads of German officials in their government. Their land is vital for our new vision of eastern Europe and with this we would stomp the Russian Influence in the region."
 reformation_of_baltic_states_ger_desc:0 "We now control all 4 of the countries from the baltic, each individually frail and weak but if we put them together in 1 big state, it would make it easier for us to control and protect the region against the Soviets, creating another superb bulwark against Communism."
 complete_operation_baltikum_ger_desc:0 "Our plans for the Baltic and Poland are complete,we asserted our dominance in the region, blocking the Soviets from advancing in this area, we can consider our job done here."
 planungsphase2_ger_desc:0 "We took control of Crimea after the treaty of brest-litovsk. This province is invaluable to us, as with it , we can now control the black sea, the trade route in it and keep a close eye on Ukraine and Romania who we are under our sphere of influence. With this also we can now respond extremely easily to any attack in the region be it from the Soviets or the Ottomans."
 plan_schwarz_ger_desc:0 "We invested a lot in Crimea in order to solidify our hold on it, with German immigration to the puppet state with even more Crimeans considering themselves German, it is time for us to invest even more in Crimea and bring it in the Reich."
 first_colonization_of_crimea_ger_desc:0 "There are already plenty of germans that moved to Crimea but the bulk of the population is still Crimean. Germans need to be atleast close to the % of Crimeans in the region in order to consider this place as truly German."
 second_colonization_of_crimea_ger_desc:0 "Now that there is an equal number of germans and crimeans living in Crimea, we can push it even further, not only Germanising Crimea but making it into a fortress from where we can command both the Black Sea and the Mediterranean."
 development_of_crimea_ger_desc:0 "During the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s, we invested a lot of money in Easter Europe, particulary in Crimea in order to make it acceptable for germans to even consider moving there but in order to creating this "sea fortress" we have to invest a lot more ,particulary in infrastructure and Industry."
 befriend_kuban_ger_desc:0 "Kuban is one of the new countries in Europe, however their lack of history or national identity can somewhat be forgotton since they are a country rich in resources such as Steel and Oil which can make a nice trade partner. By befriending them and bringing them into our sphere of influence, we may detter the Soviets from expanding this way."
 invite_ukraine_ger_desc:0 "Ukraine's position is perfect for a strike again the Soviet Union, being relatively close to the big Soviet Cities which could enable us to be a lot more relaxed in case of war with the Soviet Union."
 annex_crimea_ger_desc:0 "After all our efforts, Crimea can finally be considered German and deserves a place in the empire."
 complete_plan_schwarz_ger_desc:0 "Schwarz was a succesful plan as we succeded in germanising Crimea and asserting our dominance in the black sea while further influencing states like Kuban and Ukraine."
 war_with_soviet_ger_desc:0 "The time is right to strike eastwards, because our succesful plans we can now attack the Soviets from all important sides. Being forced to fight a war on such a big line, our experts say that the Soviets will be decimated by our glorious Empire easily."
 improve_relation_baltikum_2_ger_desc:0 "The baltic states are being target by the Soviet Union, as the defenders of Europe we must assure them of their independence"
 improve_relation_baltikum_ger_desc:0 "The baltic states are being target by the Soviet Union, as the defenders of Europe we must assure them of their independence"
 war_with_sov_ger_desc:0 "The best defense is the offense. We must strike at the Soviets before they attack us or any other country in Europe."
 befriend_benelux_ger_desc:0 "The BeNe-Countries are in the crosshairs of the British and French Empires, we must make it clear that the BeNe-Countries will be helped in any case of war."
