 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Period of Tension"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Weltkrieg has changed the world and people forever. The German Empire now has the leading position in europe and the world. On the other hand, radical political parties have reached high popularity in the former countries of the Entente. Even though they have different political ideologies, there is one thing they have in common: They are seeking for revenge."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Britain's pride lies on the ground, the once world-wide empire, was not only humiliated by Germany, it also lost a large portion of its colonies overseas. The states of the Commenwealth are united only by the crown. India had to be granted independence. Our political system is about to collapse, the British citizens demand justice. We are facing a crossroads. We can go with the radical political current and look for a new confrontation, or follow the path of diplomacy and reconstruction, and rebuild the Commonwealth again in order to bring Germany's aggression into line..."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France lost the Great War on the side of the allies. The Treaty of Nürnberg forced France to cede parts of their colonial territory and imposed a lot of debts on the country. The economic situation was terrible and people were frustrated about government and the lost war. The overall situation encouraged growth of radical movements like the communists and the fascists. The ruling democratic party lost a lot of their popularity year after year..."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the war was over, Germany was able to increase its power significantly. Russia got heavily punished by losing a lot of its territory and the communists gained the power of the country. On the area of the lost territory, several countries got established which were dependent on Germany. The Crimea and Poland are still puppets, the other states are mainly independent now. Germany is now owning a exclave on the Crimea (Alutscha Exklave). The Central Powers still exist but Austria-Hungary (now the United States of Greater Austria) is not a member anymore and the Ottoman Empire decays. " 
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italy lost the Great War on the side of the allies. The country had to pay a lot of reparations and lost the island Rhodos to the Ottoman Empire. In postwar years, the fascist party under the rule of Benito Mussolini gained big popularity..."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Japanese people and our emperor were again humiliated and deceived by the European powers in the World War, with dare promises we were drawn into a war that had already been lost. At the moment the dominant German influence in Asia keeps us from gaining the dream of our nation, a predominance position in Asia. But the divine winds are in our favor. The grip of the German emporer in Asia gets weaker as Europe is seething under its surface... Be it through negotiation or the sword, the Germans will not prevent the rise of our empire for long."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The peace of Brest-Litovsk lies as a heavy legacy on the still unconsolidated elite of the Soviet Union. Large areas in the Baltic States, Ukraine and the Caucasus had to be granted independence on German pressure. Trotsky still finds himself firmly in the saddle, but some comrades have been able to gain enough support in the communist party and the population to become a serious danger. The Soviet Union is still held back, not only by their foreign policy setbacks, but also by the internal power struggle and poor economic development. Nevertheless, the communists are strong in Russia, strong enough to persist in the long run and ultimately carry the revolution into neighboring countries."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States were deeply concerned about the slaughter in Europe, but decided to not take any part in the Great War. The political elite did not show much enthusiasm for the new pre-eminence of Germany in Europe, but has not been able to reposition itself due to the political unwillingness of the population. The Great Depression in the wake of the global economic crisis of 1929, and a subsequent food crisis due to the ceasing foreign trade, kept our nation in a state of flux. Nearly daily, our economy is shrinking and many people are suffering from hunger. If we want to solve these great domestic problems, we must find a new direction for our foreign policy."
